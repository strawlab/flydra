= Overview of the Flydra Trigger Device =

The Flydra Trigger Device serves to provide a synchronized trigger
signal to all cameras providing input to the Main Brain. By use of a
custom trigger device, precise timing of frame-by-frame inputs can be
verified. (See source:trunk/flydra/flydra/a2/check_atmel_clock.py
script for an example.) Furthermore, additional experimental
components can be triggered by the device by use of the External
Device Trigger.

This device is an AT90USBKEY ( http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3879 ) placed
in a custom enclosure with some minimal additional circuitry and
custom firmware.

The primary connections are A) the USB interface, which connects to
the Main Brain computer, and B) the Camera Sync Triggers, which
connects to the flydra cameras.

In addition the External Device Trigger, can be used to trigger
experimental devices via a software command from the Main Brain
computer over the USB interface.

= Internal connection details =

The Camera Sync Triggers are the bottom row of BNCs on the
device. Internally, they all share the same input. This is a direct
connection from the AT90USBKEY J5 pin 7 (and thus Port C6, OCR3A, of
the AT90USB1287). Optionally, an op-amp to provide a 5V trigger signal
may be added (see below).

The External Device Trigger is the top left BNC on the
device. Internally, this is a direct connection from the AT90USBKEY J5
pin 4 (and thus Port C3 of the AT90USB1287). Optionally, an op-amp to
provide a 5V trigger signal may be added (see below).

= Optional 5V outputs =

An optional Op-Amp may be used to boost the output signal voltage from
3.3V to 5.0V.

In the drawing above, V_{CST} are the Camera Sync Triggers, V_{ETD} is
the External Device Trigger. J5 refers to the jumper on the AT90USBKEY
device. R1-4 should be chosen to give the appropriate gain. Values of
100 ohms for R1 and R3 and 200 ohms for R2 and R4 should work. The +5
V power should be taken from an external power supply, which can be
connected into the trigger box via the provided plug.
