montage_ufmf:

	added 2 new options:
		nth_frame=save only every nth frame, default=1

		frames_test= name of a .csv file that contains the frames that contains at least two columns- 1)frame 			numbers, 2)object_ids. This file is now required. My Data_cropped_manipulated.csv files work as inputs for this. Now the 3d_smoothed_orientation will only show the orientations of frames that are included in the frames_test file.





image_based_orientation:

	1.) Stacks every other frame. (currently only supports stack-n-frames=5, or else it doesn't work. stack-n-min should also be 3 or less or it doesn't really make sense)

	2.) Image processing works as follows:
		1.) Does first pass with int-thresh-frac=.7 (later will change this to an input parameter)
		2.) Looks for multiple COM of multiple blobs in the image, calculates distance to previous frame COM.
		3.) Assumes blob closest to previous COM is the good one, as long as it is within 15 pixels (later should make this an input parameter).
			3b.) if it is too far, uses previous frame's COM.

		4.) Then, using the COM calculated in the previous steps and the image transformed by the input parameters (int_thresh_frac, erode, etc) it looks for the blob closest to the COM, and then blacks out everything else.
		5.) Uses this image for the stack.
